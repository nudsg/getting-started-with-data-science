Introduction

[Big Data vs. Analytics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPGzOw_KcBk)

- Big Data is a description of an engineering problem
- Analytics is a description of a way of generating value from data

### Look at the question you are trying to answer
1 - The objective you are trying to drive (ex. maximize profits)
2 - The leaders (what are the things that I can actually change, that are going to impact the objective?)

- Data Science is about the people, not the tools
